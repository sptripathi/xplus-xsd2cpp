    If you have gone through W3C XML-Schema specifications, then you would probably agree that it is very extensive.<br>
    As we are at <b>release 0.1</b>, not everything from the specification is supported currently.<br>
    However, by <b>release 0.3</b>, we aim to support every item from following XML-Schema specifications/versions: 
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/">XML Schema Part 1: Structures Second Edition</a>
      <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition</a>
    </ul>
    <br><br> 
    This section strives to document all those XML-Schema specification items that are not supported by XmlPlus. If you find something that you think is not supported by XmlPlus, but is not listed here, please let us know: email us at <a href="mailto:xmlplus.custodians@gmail.com">xmlplus.custodians@gmail.com</a>.
    <br><br>
